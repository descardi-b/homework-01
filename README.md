🌸 hey there! 🌸 
welcome to my homework 01 repo.

here's the work i've done for the uc berkley coding bootcamp's module 1 challenge assignment. in this challenge, i was tasked with: 

🍓 consolidating redundant attributes within the css stylesheet
🍓 ensuring that all anchor links were functional
🍓 providing appropriate alt text for each image on the page.

here are some screenshots of my work: <img src="./assets/images/Horiseon-01.png" alt="first screenshot of the Horiseon webpage"><img src="./assets/images/Horiseon-02.png" alt="second screenshot of the Horiseon webpage">
