🌸 hey there! 🌸 
welcome to my homework 01 repo.

here's the work i've done for the uc berkley coding bootcamp's module 1 challenge assignment. in this challenge, i was tasked with: 

🍓 consolidating redundant attributes within the css stylesheet
🍓 ensuring that all anchor links were functional
🍓 providing appropriate alt text for each image on the page.
